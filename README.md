Summary:
        Under the guidance of Professor Samina Shakeel, I performed a comprehensive in silico analysis to identify and characterize an unknown genetic sequence. The study comprised of DNA, RNA, and Protein levels, involving ORF identification, RNA secondary structure prediction, and protein domain analysis. By integrating results from multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic studies, the sequence was conclusively identified as the Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor D.This gene belongs to the organism Homo Sapiens and is located on Chromosome 19.NCBi BLAST, ORF FINDER ,EXPASY, UNIPROT, VIENNA RNA WEB SERVER, CLUSTALW,PFAM PREDICTPROTEIN, CELLO, TARGETP, STRING and other tools were used for this analysis.The project successfully mapped the protein's structural properties, subcellular localization, and interaction networks.THANKS to professor Samina Shakeel for guiding me to complete this project.
